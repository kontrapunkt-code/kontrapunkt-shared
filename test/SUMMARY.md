# Test Suite Summary

## Overview

We've created a comprehensive test suite for the `@kontrapunkt/shared` package, focusing on its core functionality of copying shared configuration files to target directories. The tests are designed to run with Bun's built-in test runner.

## Created Files

- `test/index.test.ts` - Main functionality tests
- `test/error-handling.test.ts` - Error handling and edge case tests
- `test/cli.test.ts` - Tests for the CLI functionality
- `test/README.md` - Documentation for the test suite

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

1. **Core functionality** of the `copySharedFiles` function:
   - Copying all files when no specific files are requested
   - Copying only specified files
   - Directory copying
   - Interactive mode behavior
   - Custom file destinations

2. **Error handling** for various scenarios:
   - Missing shared directory
   - File read/write errors
   - Handling non-existent files

3. **CLI functionality** through module mocking

## Testing Techniques

The test suite demonstrates several testing techniques:

1. **Isolated testing** using temporary directories
2. **Mocking**:
   - User input/prompts
   - File system operations
   - Module imports
3. **Setup and teardown** using beforeEach/afterEach hooks
4. **Error condition simulation**

## Running Tests

All tests can be run using the `bun test` command. The tests are designed to be non-destructive and clean up after themselves.

## Next Steps

Possible improvements to the test suite:

1. Add more edge case tests
2. Add integration tests with actual file system operations
3. Add property-based tests for more robust testing
4. Set up test coverage reporting
